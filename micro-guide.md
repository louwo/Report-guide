# Weekly report for Connext router applicant's.
   
***First***, let's go through a quick registration in GitHub. (yes, you can't send a report without it)
   
***Now*** let's go to the Connext repository (*I'll leave a link right away to create a report, it will be easier this way*)
   
   - https://github.com/fmanea/ConnextRouterTrack/new/main/submissions
   
 And the first thing we need to do is name the file correctly, for this you need to use your nickname and add .md
   - For me it will look like this

So let's move on to filling, for convenience, you can use my template. Just copy the content and paste it into your yet  empty report
